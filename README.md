# Predictor Informed Bayesian Dynamic Functional Connectivity
This is a repository for the Matlab implementation of the Predictor-Informed Dynamic Functional Connectivity model of Lee et al, along with an implementation of the graph-based Bayesian Dynamic Functional Connectivity Model by Warnick et al. 

## Examples
There are 2 matlab scripts walking through how to fit the models using simulated data: [pibdfc_example.m](https://github.com/jayesrule/PIBDFC/blob/public/pibdfc_example.m) and [bdfc_example.m](https://github.com/jayesrule/PIBDFC/blob/public/bdfc_example.m)

Following will be a walkthrough of a simulated data analysis using pibdfc.

# Simulating the Data

# Setting the Prior Hyperparameters

# Fitting the Model

# Model Convergence Checks
