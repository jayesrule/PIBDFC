# Predictor Informed Bayesian Dynamic Functional Connectivity
This is a repository for the Matlab implementation of the Predictor-Informed Dynamic Functional Connectivity model of Lee et al, along with an implementation of the graph-based Bayesian Dynamic Functional Connectivity Model by Warnick et al. 

## Examples
There are 2 matlab scripts walking through how to fit the models using simulated data: pibdfc_example.m and bdfc_example.m
